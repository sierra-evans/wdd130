                <p class="odysea-info">
                    OdySea Aquarium boasts an expansive roster of sea life, and it is a great place to go for an entertaining but also educational trip. 
                    Located in Scottsdale, they offer three different up-close and personal encounters with the animals and sea life housed there, which can be 
                    purchased for an additional fee, as they are not included in the price of admission. An annual pass is available should you be interested.

                    Located in the same lot as OdySea in Scottsdale, Butterfly Wonderland is a cheaper option, should you still want a fun, educational activity. 
                    Being one of the largest butterfly conservatories in North America, there is plenty of excitement and learning to be had here. Besides 
                    butterflies, there is also a rainforest reptile exhibit, a honeybee extravaganza, and many other insects on display, just waiting to be seen 
                    and studied by you!

                <p class="zoo-info">
                    The Phoenix Zoo is located in beautiful, sunny Phoenix. Due to the extremely hot temperatures in the summer, it is recommended that visits are 
                    planned on cooler days, as most of your time will be spent outside. Being one of the largest non-profit zoos in North America, the Phoenix Zoo 
                    houses over 3,000 animals with nearly 400 species throughout. Many of the animals located here are endangered or threatened, and it is the zoo's 
                    mission to bring them out of those categories through their breeding and conservation programs. There are many programs and experiences for guests 
                    to enjoy, such as stingray bay, the petting zoo, monkey village, and more!
