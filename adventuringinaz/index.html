                    Arizona became an official member of the United States of America on February 14th, 1912, when it became the 48th state to be added to the country. 
                    One of the most interesting things about Arizona is its climate. Ranging from desert, to forest, to even subtropical areas, there are so many 
                    places in nature to explore here for outdoor enthusiasts. There are also hosts of historical monuments and other intriguing places to explore 
                    here, if you are not one who hears the call of nature. No matter what type of person you are, or what type of adventures you seek, Arizona is 
                    sure to have something that suits your tastes!
