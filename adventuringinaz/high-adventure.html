                    Sedona is one of the most beautiful cities in Arizona, with its rich history and breathtaking red rock views. There are many companies that offer 
                    jeep and hummer tours, where they will have a professional driver take your group out into the rugged terrain to see the many views that Sedona 
                    has to offer. You can choose the type of terrain/trails you would like to explore, ranging from mild to extreme. Most trips will last about two 
                    hours and while the number of people allowed per group depends on the vehicle and company you book with, most often it is anywhere between 
                    4-7 people.

                <p class="bright-info">
                    One of the many trails located in the Grand Canyon, this trail is said to be one of the more difficult ones, so be sure to properly prepare 
                    before attempting it. This 15.3-mile hike goes out and back, providing rocky terrain, little shade, and breathtaking views. It is common to 
                    see lots of other people on the trail, as it is popular for hikers, backpackers, and campers alike. It is important to note that dogs are not 
                    allowed on the trail, so be sure to leave any furry friends at home for this adventure.

                    Located just a 10-minute drive east from Page, Antelope Canyon provides a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. The canon takes on a wave-like 
                    appearance, making it a popular tourist destination for its interesting views. There are many different tours available that go through both 
                    the upper and lower portions of the canyon, but it is important to be in shape and come prepared for the hikes ahead.
