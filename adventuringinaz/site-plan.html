        <p>Goals</p>
          <p>The goal for my site is to assist people who are looking for things to do in Arizona. People will come to my site because it will provide good information on the different types of experiences Arizona has to offer.
          Visitors to my site will expect the site to answer the question of “what can I do with my free time in Arizona today?” or “what activities can I plan on doing when I visit Arizona?”
          The activities that visitors will want to complete on my site are quite simple. My site serves mostly as an informational site and will provide links to the proper outside websites where the visitor can purchase tickets if needed for an activity or where they can learn even more information about said activity.
          I will provide visitors to my site with the basic information they need to make an informed decision on whether they want to pursue an activity listed on my site.
          Visitors will come to my site over other sites because the information is displayed in a clean and concise way. There will also be no ads and no affiliate links, so the visitor knows they are getting just the facts, and no biased information.</p>
        <p>Basic Information About Arizona</p>
          <p>Arizona became an official member of the United States of America on February 14th, 1912, when it became the 48th state to be added to the country. One of the most interesting things about Arizona is its climate. Ranging from desert, to forest, to even subtropical areas, there are so many places in nature to explore here for outdoor enthusiasts. There are also hosts of historical monuments and other intriguing places to explore here, if you are not one who hears the call of nature. No matter what type of person you are, or what type of adventures you seek, Arizona is sure to have something that suits your tastes!</p>

      <h3>High Adventure</h3>
      <p>
          <p>Sedona Jeep Tours</p>
            <p>Sedona is one of the most beautiful cities in Arizona, with its rich history and breathtaking red rock views. There are many companies that offer jeep and hummer tours, where they will have a professional driver take your group out into the rugged terrain to see the many views that Sedona has to offer. You can choose the type of terrain/trails you would like to explore, ranging from mild to extreme. Most trips will last about two hours and while the number of people allowed per group depends on the vehicle and company you book with, most often it is anywhere between 4-7 people.</p>
          <p>Bright Angel Trail</p>
            <p>One of the many trails located in the Grand Canyon, this trail is said to be one of the more difficult ones, so be sure to properly prepare before attempting it. This 15.3-mile hike goes out and back, providing rocky terrain, little shade, and breathtaking views. It is common to see lots of other people on the trail, as it is popular for hikers, backpackers, and campers alike. It is important to note that dogs are not allowed on the trail, so be sure to leave any furry friends at home for this adventure. </p>
          <p>Antelope Canyon</p>
            <p>Located just a 10-minute drive east from Page, Antelope Canyon provides a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. The canon takes on a wave-like appearance, making it a popular tourist destination for its interesting views. There are many different tours available that go through both the upper and lower portions of the canyon, but it is important to be in shape and come prepared for the hikes ahead. </p>

      <h3>Low Adventure</h3>
      <p>
        <p>OdySea Aquarium </p>
          <p>OdySea Aquarium boasts an expansive roster of sea life, and it is a great place to go for an entertaining but also educational trip. Located in Scottsdale, they offer three different up-close and personal encounters with the animals and sea life housed there, which can be purchased for an additional fee, as they are not included in the price of admission. An annual pass is available should you be interested.</p>
        <p>Butterfly Wonderland</p>
          <p>Located in the same lot as OdySea in Scottsdale, Butterfly Wonderland is a cheaper option, should you want a fun, educational activity. Being one of the largest butterfly conservatories in North America, there is plenty of excitement and learning to be had here. Besides butterflies, there is also a rainforest reptile exhibit, a honeybee extravaganza, and many other insects on display, just waiting to be seen and studied by you!</p>
        <p>Phoenix Zoo</p>
          <p>The Phoenix Zoo is located in beautiful, sunny Phoenix. Due to the extremely hot temperatures in the summer, it is recommended that visits are planned on cooler days, as most of your time will be spent outside. Being one of the largest non-profit zoos in North America, the Phoenix Zoo houses over 3,000 animals with nearly 400 species throughout. Many of the animals located here are endangered or threatened, and it is the zoo’s mission to bring them out of those categories through their breeding and conservation programs. There are many programs and experiences for guests to enjoy, such as stingray bay, the petting zoo, monkey village, and more! </p>
