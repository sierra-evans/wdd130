        <p>I'm currently a software engineering major and I'm considering going to grad school for biomedical engineering.</p>
        <p>I love to play video games, watch movies, read, go on hikes, and listen to music.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to have a career in web design/programming in general because there is a lot of potential for growth and they usually get paid a lot haha.</p>
